# ai-car-neural-net

A code-along course from Professor Radu Mariescu-Istodor.

This project involved building a scrolling road, and a controllable car. 

Collision impact sensors were then added to the car, and the neural network was trained to avoid colliding into the rear of other cars.

The model will create hundreds of instances of the car, and then select for a car which progresses the furthest along the road without colliding.

When a good model is found, this can then be saved and further improvements can be made.

The next steps for this project are to allow the car to overtake other cars without collisions.
